The Azure Time Series Insights JavaScript SDK (aka **tsiclient**) is a JavaScript library for Microsoft Azure Time Series Insights, featuring components for data visualization and analytics, utilities for making calls directly to the TSI Platform API, and more.  **tsiclient** also ships with an associated CSS file (which you must include using your preferred css linking method), which makes the components look great out of the box.

## Installing

If you use npm, `npm install tsiclient`. You can also load directly from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/tsiclient/). For example:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/tsiclient@latest/tsiclient.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://unpkg.com/tsiclient@latest/tsiclient.css"></link>
```

To import all of **tsiclient** into an ES2015 application, import everything into a namespace, like so...

```js
import TsiClient from "tsiclient";

// later, when you want a line chart
let tsiClient = new TsiClient();
let lineChart = new tsiClient.ux.LineChart(document.getElementById('chart'));
```

You can also import components individually.  If you only need the LineChart, you can import it like so...

```js
import LineChart from 'tsiclient/LineChart'

// later when you want a line chart
let lineChart = new LineChart(document.getElementById('chart'));
```
Importing individual components can help significantly reduce your bundle size as they work better with tree shaking. This is the recommended approach if your app only consumes specific components.

To import the tsiclient stylesheet into an ES2015 application, import either `tsiclient.css` or `tsiclient.min.css`, like so...

```js
import 'tsiclient/tsiclient.css' // Standard styles
import 'tsiclient/tsiclient.min.css' // Minified styles
```

## Release Notes

Starting with version 1.3.0, discrete events and state transitions will be represented just like numeric time series in the LineChart component.  This may be a breaking change for users representing non-numeric series in the line chart using the "events" and "states" Chart Options.  For usage instructions, consult [this example](https://tsiclientsample.azurewebsites.net/noauth/multipleseriestypes.html) and the associated [documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/tsiclient/blob/master/docs/UX.md#line-chart).
